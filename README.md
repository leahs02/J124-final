# On Addiction:
### *"If we're lucky, we might think of it as something we see out in our streets, but for some of us, it’s in our homes.”* 
I worked with Columbus Public Health, the Columbus, Ohio Health Department in the summer of 2021. I interned with the Alcohol & Drug Services department on their project funded by a SAMHSA grant (SAMHSA refers to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration which is a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services). I spent my mornings hanging out at gas stations, offering Narcan to parked cars; my afternoons in the woods off 71 North passing out clean syringes, and my evenings cooking dinner at a safe house, listening to working women tell their tails of the day. Needless to say, it was an experience—an englighting, humbling, heartbreaking, frustrating experience. I could go on here, forever even, about my time that summer. However, I will put that story on hold, for now. 

I want to talk about addiction as a disease. And by disease, I mean disease. Not to be confused with “addiction as poor life choices” or “addiction as bad luck” or “addiction as a result of poor parenting”. I did, in fact, mean to type, “addiction as a disease”. 

I think that the gravity of that statement often gets brushed aside. Some take it to be a PC push for treating addicts like real people, some want to argue it’s just an excuse. 

It’s not, though. A disease is a disorder or condition with a distinctive set of symptoms, signs or anatomical changes. 

I could get into Susan Sontag’s Illness as Metaphor if I wanted to try and convince you that although addiction isn’t a pretty disease, it is a disease nonetheless. 

I could get into research about how the brain becomes physiologically changed after prolonged drug use.

But for now, I will skip that step and assume that we can agree addiction is a disease and thus should be treated like one.

So, I have seen the opioid epidemic first hand. Obviously, I had a thousand different questions. At first, my nativity pondered questions such as “what would lead a person to use?”. 

**Then I heard a story about a girl who was prescribed oxycodone, an opioid, after twisting her ankle pretty badly one day. The pain in her ankle turned chronic and she continued on opioids for months before she tried heroin.**

**Then I heard a story of a girl who’s mom had sold prescription pills since before the girl was born. The mother had her daughter injecting intravenously before 12.**

**Then I heard about neonatal abstinence syndrome: found in babies whose mother used during pregnancy, which causes exposure to opioids in utero. The baby is born dependent– addicted at birth– often dying from withdrawal symptoms.**

Addiction is a **multifaceted phenomenon** that we have created for ourselves. Although there is no **one “cure” for addiction**, there are things that we can do. There is preventative care, drug assisted therapies, rehabilitation courses, and much more. I am no expert in anything, but I feel I might as well toss my hat into the ring: if we can **reframe our thinking away from questions blaming those suffering from addiction** and widen our gaze to the bigger picture, we might have a chance at fighting this thing. So I ask the question, ***America, what are *you* doing to deal with addiction?***

Through exploratory analysis on the CDC’s data collected during the 2018 survey or something, I will illustrate the impact of the opioid crisis in America, contemplate its influences, and outline the current policies being implemented to handle it. 

# What are Opioids?
### Analysis 1: Opioids

**Opioids** is an all ecompassing term referring to natural, semi - synthetic, and synthetic opioids. _Opiates_ are natural opioids, which are directly derived the extremely addictive latex of the seeds of the Papaver Somniferu, or opium poppies. Examples include heroin, morphine and codeine. Synthetic opiods are chemically made with examples including tramadol and fentanyl. Semi-synthetic opiods land in a grey area in between, kind of like GMOs. Heroin is an example of a semi-synthetic opioid because it is made from morphine, an opiate, but has been chemically processed. Other examples of semi-synthetic opioids include oxycodone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, and oxymorphone.

--> Analysis of NCBI graph on the potencies of different drugs: i think that this would be a helpful visual for readers to understand how serious drugs can be and poisonous drugs can be.

--> analysis on the CDC OD data: i can group the data by the type of opioid it is (but that will probably just tell me that synthetic kills at a higher rate and isnt that cool so idk

# Who is being effected?
### Analysis 2: Fatal Overdoses by State

little blurb on how i looked at this data and got that

What do our findings tell us? well that its localized in appalacia. Why is this that the case? well let me tell you a little story about the sackler family. 

# The Sackler story 

Keep it short keep it brief

The first time the FDA labeled a class 2 narcotic as “less addictive” 

Internal debate about the warning label: some people didn’t think that Perdue had proven it was true
- They agreed it would be abused
- Curitis wright: the guy that approved the FDA label and then two years later resigned from the FDA and started working at Perdue Pharma 


Perdue pharma creating a **“war on pain”**. Give the data from googles etymology on the word

# Where did the drugs go?
### Analysis 3: Perscription opioids per capita per state

We saw that the drug OD rates were the highest in appalacia, so  how did the drugs get there in the first place for peole to start abusing them?

- analysis from CDC data on prescriptions per state.

# OD throughout history 
### Analysis 4: Fatal Overdoses in American History


More data on ODs, but instead of state specific, i use a differnt set of total OD in the country over time. 

# who is taking the drugs?
### Analysis 5: Fatal Overdoses by Demographics


- do an analysis of drug OD by demographic: i haev a dataset that breaks down use by age and gender?

# People to contact

CPH people because they have the data I want and there is an established relationship 

Gabor Maté bc im reading his book and he could consult for implementation of preventative care 

# Further Research

CPH stuff
